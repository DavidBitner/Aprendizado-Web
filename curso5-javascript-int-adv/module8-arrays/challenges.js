 * Atividade 1
 *
 * Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
 * Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
 *
 * 1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shadow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
 * 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
 * 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
 * 4. Run the function for both test datasets
 *
 * TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
 * TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

/**
 * Atividade 2
 *
 * Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
 *
 * Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
 *
 * 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
 * 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
 * 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs
 * 4. Run the function for both test datasets
 *
 * TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
 * TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

/**
 * Atividade 4
 *
 * Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are eating too much or too little.
 * Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
 * Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10% above and 10% below the recommended portion.
 *
 * 1. Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do NOT create a new array, simply loop over the array. Formula: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
 * 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too little. HINT: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose)
 * 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little ('ownersEatTooLittle').
 * 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat too little!"
 * 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating EXACTLY the amount of food that is recommended (just true or false)
 * 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an OKAY amount of food (just true or false)
 * 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an OKAY amount of food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
 * 8. Create a shallow copy of the dogs array and sort it by recommended food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the array's objects)
 *
 * HINT 1: Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary lecture to choose between them
 * HINT 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the recommended portion.
 *
 * TEST DATA:
 * const dogs = [
 *   { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice', 'Bob'] },
 *   { weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ['Matilda'] },
 *   { weight: 13, curFood: 275, owners: ['Sarah', 'John'] },
 *   { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ['Michael'] }
