Target Audience
The types of organizations that might use Scrumban are:
1. Organizations that use agile methods like Scrum for a long time, and want to change roles and the flow of work to not be as set into a framework, so they will use Scrumban as a form of transition method to make sure they are ready to go to Kanban

2. Newer organizations that need an agile framework but don't have the need or simply don't want the roles inside Scrum, they want a more flexible way of progressing work
